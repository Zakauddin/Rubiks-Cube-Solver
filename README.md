# Rubik's Cube Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation for solving a Rubik's Cube using the breadth-first search algorithm. The project includes both a graphical user interface (GUI) representation of the cube and a command-line interface for solving.

## Usage
Set the starting position of the Rubik's Cube:

- You can edit the starting faces in the code.
- Alternatively, add rotation functions defined in the code after line 307 in the main.py file.

## Files

- `main.py`: This file runs the Rubik's Cube Solver with a GUI representation of the 3D cube.
- `command_line.py`: This file provides a command-line only interface for solving the Rubik's Cube Solver.
